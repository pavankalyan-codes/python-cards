## Learning Path 🛤️

The cards are designed to build knowledge progressively:

1. Start with basic data types (Lists, Dictionaries)
2. Learn operations for each data type
3. Explore advanced concepts (Sets, Tuples)
4. Master comprehensions and advanced operations

## Tips for Learning 💡

- **Practice** the syntax examples in a Python environment
- **Experiment** with the code snippets
